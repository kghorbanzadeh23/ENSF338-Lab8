# Topological sorting can be implemented using Depth-First Search (DFS).
# Finding Cycles: Only Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) allow for topological
# sorting. A graph's cycles may be found using DFS, which is important because
# a topological sort cannot be completed in the presence of a cycle.

# Ordering: Before turning around, DFS travels as far as feasible down each branch.
# This parameter makes sure that all outgoing edges from a node are visited before the
# node is closed, meaning that all descendants of a given node are visited before the node
# is finished. This is a useful characteristic since a node in a topological sort has to come
# after all of its dependencies, or graph descendants.

# Stack Usage: To preserve the vertex order in a DFS implementation for topological sorting,
# a stack is usually employed. A vertex is pushed into the stack each time it is completed,
# meaning that all of its edges have been investigated. The stack has a legitimate topological
# ordering from the bottom to the top once every vertex has been visited.
